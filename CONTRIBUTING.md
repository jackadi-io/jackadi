# Contributing guide

## Features

Before implementing and submitting any new features, please open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/jackadi-io/jackadi/discussions) (or open an issue).

The approach with Jackadi is to only include the essential features. Advanced features that can be achieved using another tool should use that tool (e.g. secret management, job scheduler, etc...).

The commit message must be clear and well documented.

## Issues

Please open a GitHub issue before/with the Pull Request.

## LLM Coding assitant

For any of your contribution, please mention if you used a coding assistant and how. This is essential to review the Pull Request properly.
